// MinerPhase is a string representation of a Miner Phase.
//
// This type is a high-level indicator of the status of the Miner as it is provisioned,
// from the API user’s perspective.
//
// The value should not be interpreted by any software components as a reliable indication
// of the actual state of the Miner, and controllers should not use the Miner Phase field
// value when making decisions about what action to take.
//
// Controllers should always look at the actual state of the Miner’s fields to make those decisions.
