.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBzero-minerset-controller\fP [OPTIONS]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The cloud minerset controller is a daemon that embeds
the core control loops. In applications of robotics and
automation, a control loop is a non-terminating loop that regulates the state of
the system. In Zero, a controller is a control loop that watches the shared
state of the minerset through the zero-apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the
current state towards the desired state.
