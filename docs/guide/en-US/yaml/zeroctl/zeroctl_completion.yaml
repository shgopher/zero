name: completion
synopsis: |
    Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash, zsh, fish, or powershell)
description: |-
    Output shell completion code for the specified shell (bash or zsh). The shell code must be evaluated to provide interactive completion of zeroctl commands.  This can be done by sourcing it from the .bash_profile.

     Detailed instructions on how to do this are available here: http://github.com/superproj/zero/docs/installation/zeroctl.md#enabling-shell-autocompletion

     Note for zsh users: [1] zsh completions are only supported in versions of zsh >= 5.2
inheritedOptions:
    - name: gateway.address
      usage: The address and port of the Zero API server
    - name: gateway.certificate-authority
      usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
    - name: gateway.insecure-skip-tls-verify
      defaultValue: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
    - name: gateway.max-retries
      defaultValue: "0"
      usage: Maximum number of retries.
    - name: gateway.retry-interval
      defaultValue: 0s
      usage: The interval time between each attempt.
    - name: gateway.timeout
      defaultValue: 0s
      usage: |
        The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
    - name: profile
      defaultValue: none
      usage: |
        Name of profile to capture. One of (none|cpu|heap|goroutine|threadcreate|block|mutex)
    - name: profile-output
      defaultValue: profile.pprof
      usage: Name of the file to write the profile to
    - name: user.client-certificate
      usage: Path to a client certificate file for TLS
    - name: user.client-key
      usage: Path to a client key file for TLS
    - name: user.password
      usage: Password for basic authentication to the API server
    - name: user.secret-id
      usage: SecretID for JWT authentication to the API server
    - name: user.secret-key
      usage: SecretKey for jwt authentication to the API server
    - name: user.token
      usage: Bearer token for authentication to the API server
    - name: user.username
      usage: Username for basic authentication to the API server
    - name: usercenter.address
      usage: The address and port of the Zero API server
    - name: usercenter.certificate-authority
      usage: Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
    - name: usercenter.insecure-skip-tls-verify
      defaultValue: "false"
      usage: |
        If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
    - name: usercenter.max-retries
      defaultValue: "0"
      usage: Maximum number of retries.
    - name: usercenter.retry-interval
      defaultValue: 0s
      usage: The interval time between each attempt.
    - name: usercenter.timeout
      defaultValue: 0s
      usage: |
        The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests.
    - name: version
      defaultValue: "false"
      usage: Print version information and quit
    - name: warnings-as-errors
      defaultValue: "false"
      usage: |
        Treat warnings received from the server as errors and exit with a non-zero exit code
    - name: zeroconfig
      usage: Path to the zeroconfig file to use for CLI.
