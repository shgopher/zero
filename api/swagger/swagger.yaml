                    should contain a valid JSON/Go field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                    For example, if the object reference is to a container within a pod, this would take on a value like:
                    "spec.containers{name}" (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
                    the event) or if no container name is specified "spec.containers[2]" (container with
                    index 2 in this pod). This syntax is chosen only to have some well-defined way of
                    referencing a part of an object.

            ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
            users must create. This is a copy of customizable fields from metav1.ObjectMeta.

            ObjectMeta is embedded in `Miner.Spec` and `MinerSet.Template`,
            which are not top-level Kubernetes objects. Given that metav1.ObjectMeta has lots of special cases
            and read-only fields which end up in the generated CRD validation, having it as a subset simplifies
            the API and some issues that can impact user experience.

            During the [upgrade to controller-tools@v2](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/pull/1054)
            for v1alpha2, we noticed a failure would occur running Cluster API test suite against the new CRDs,
            specifically `spec.metadata.creationTimestamp in body must be of type string: "null"`.
            The investigation showed that `controller-tools@v2` behaves differently than its previous version
            when handling types from [metav1](k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/apis/meta/v1) package.

            In more details, we found that embedded (non-top level) types that embedded `metav1.ObjectMeta`
            had validation properties, including for `creationTimestamp` (metav1.Time).
            The `metav1.Time` type specifies a custom json marshaller that, when IsZero() is true, returns `null`
            which breaks validation because the field isn't marked as nullable.

            In future versions, controller-tools@v2 might allow overriding the type and validation for embedded
            types. When that happens, this hack should be revisited.

            'v:<value>', where <value> is the exact json formatted value of a list item

            'k:<keys>', where <keys> is a map of  a list item's key fields to their unique values
            If a key maps to an empty Fields value, the field that key represents is part of the set.

                    Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and
                    are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.

                    Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set further into the
                    future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be deleted prior to this time.
                    For example, a user may request that a pod is deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react
                    by sending a graceful termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds,
                    the Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and after cleanup,
                    remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network partitions, this object may still
                    exist after this timestamp, until an administrator or automated process can determine the
                    resource is fully terminated.
                    If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been requested.

                    Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested.
